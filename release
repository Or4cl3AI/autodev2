// This is a placeholder for the "release" folder. The actual folder will contain all the necessary files and dependencies for the application to run, including the main application file (App.js), the ConversationalAgent component, the ChatInterface component, the sweep feature, and the Documentation component. It will also include the build and deploy scripts for automating the deployment process.
